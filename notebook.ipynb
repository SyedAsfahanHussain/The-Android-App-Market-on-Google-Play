They are easy to create and can be very lucrative from the business standpoint. Specifically, Android is expanding as an operating system and has captured more than 74% of the total market<sup><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009\">[1]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use here was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps\">Kaggle</a>.
